## Collaboration

* Always create a new work branch for different features or tasks.
* Name your work branch as your name + feature you are implementing. e.g. `eric-messaging`.
* Before you create a new work branch, always make sure to pull the latest code.
* Never push your code to master branch directly.
* Each commit should only concern its primary task. For example, if you encounter a bug and you know
  a quick fix for it, do not fix it in your current commit. Create a new commit for fixing this bug
  instead.
* Capitalize the first letter in your commit message.
