# Milestone

## Overview

Milestone is a web application that enables young adults and their service providers co-create goal plans that will lead to stability. The application contains the following features:
* Messaging between case managers and participants (youth)
* Goal creation by participants, with sharing and tracking by case managers
* Appointment scheduling and tracking between case managers and participants
* Support request creation by participants, and responding by case managers

## Core Technologies
* React.js via create-react-app (see Testing)

## Contributors

* Iean Drew
* Eric Jacobson
* Nancy Tran
* Yuliya Labaz

## Collaboration

* Always create a new work branch for different features or tasks.
* Name your work branch as your name + feature you are implementing. e.g. `eric-messaging`.
* Before you create a new work branch, always make sure to pull the latest code.
* Never push your code to master branch directly.
* Each commit should only concern its primary task. For example, if you encounter a bug and you know
  a quick fix for it, do not fix it in your current commit. Create a new commit for fixing this bug
  instead.
* Capitalize the first letter in your commit message.

## Front-end Testing
* Milestone’s front-end is built with react.js, specifically create-react-app.
	* Basic commands for testing (run via terminal in /MilestoneFrontend/:
		* npm start : Starts the development server.
		* npm run build : Bundles the app into static files for production
		* npm test : Starts the test runner.
		* npm run eject : Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!
